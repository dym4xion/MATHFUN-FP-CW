This file consists of the album data that you should use in your Haskell program. 

Your program should not process this file directly; rather, it needs to process 
a Haskell list containing the data given in this file.  

After you have worked out a suitable Album datatype you should include the data 
from this file without any modifications or additions in your program as a list 
of type [Album]; i.e.:

  testData :: [Album]
  testData = [ ... the 50 album values ... ]

This data should be used to demonstrate the correctness of your
program in the in-class demonstration. Therefore, if you have managed
to complete loading and saving of data, make sure that the testData list value
is also stored (without any modifications or additions) in an albums file.
Regardless of whether you have implemented a user interface or loading/saving,
make sure that you also complete the demo function in your program.
